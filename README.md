# Interactivity with JavaScript in the University of Michigan 

In this online course, Ã­ had to do two homeworks using Javascript. 

Javascript Homework 1

Given the HTML and CSS code for a form with both shipping and billing information, I had to add the JavaScript code needed to enable auto-complete on this form.  Whenever the checkbox is checked, the code should automatically copy the values from Shipping Name and Shipping Zip into the Billing Name and Billing Zip.  If the checkbox is unchecked, the Billing Name and Billing Zip should go blank.

Javascript Homework 2

Given the HTML and CSS code, I had to add the Javascript code which changes the image inside the box when the user hover over one of the three images to display it in the box.
